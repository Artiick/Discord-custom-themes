Originally made by https://github.com/moistp1ckle I then took it and fixed the remaining elements which were not following the GitHub color scheme. 
Elements like, hover colors, tooltips, info cards, profiles and many others + some slight UI revamps and corner softening for a better look. Hope you enjoy!
PS: It's a WIP so I'm still fixing stuff as time goes on. If you see anything funky hit me up on discord.
